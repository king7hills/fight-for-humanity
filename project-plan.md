- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify for frontend, Heroku/Render for backend

### Recommended npm Packages
- `three` - 3D rendering engine
- `socket.io` and `socket.io-client` - Real-time communication
- `express` - Backend API framework
- `mongodb` - Database interactions
- `cannon-es` - Physics engine that works with Three.js
- `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` - React wrappers for Three.js
- `react` and `react-dom` - UI components
- `vite` - Build tool and development server
- `typescript` - Type safety
- `jest` - Testing
- `eslint` and `prettier` - Code quality and formatting

## Detailed Implementation Guidelines

### Player Controller Implementation
```javascript
// Implement using Three.js and cannon-es physics
// Key features:
// - Ray casting for collision detection
// - Character controller with proper acceleration and deceleration
// - Sprint mechanic with cooldown timer
// - First-person camera with proper head bobbing
// - Jumping with gravity
```

### Networking Architecture
- Use Socket.IO rooms for separate game instances
- Implement client-side prediction with server reconciliation
- Optimize network traffic with delta compression
- Handle player interpolation for smooth movement
- Implement lag compensation techniques

### Matchmaking System
- Queue players based on connection time
- Balance teams automatically
- Scale win conditions based on team sizes
- Handle disconnections gracefully
- Allow for multiple concurrent matches

### Weapon System
- Create modular weapon class hierarchy
- Balance weapons based on damage, fire rate, accuracy, and recoil
- Implement realistic reloading mechanics
- Add visual and audio feedback for shooting
- Create aim down sight functionality with FOV changes

### Best Practices for Implementation

#### Performance Optimization
- Use object pooling for projectiles and effects
- Implement level of detail (LOD) for models
- Optimize render loop and physics calculations
- Use instanced mesh rendering for similar objects
- Implement frustum culling

#### Code Quality
- Use TypeScript for all game logic
- Follow OOP principles with clear separation of concerns
- Implement entity-component system where appropriate
- Write unit tests for core game mechanics
- Document code thoroughly with JSDoc comments

#### Networking
- Minimize network traffic with delta encoding
- Implement secure websocket connections
- Add reconnection handling
- Use binary protocols for data transfer when possible
- Add server validation for all client actions

#### Security
- Validate all user inputs on server
- Implement rate limiting
- Keep game logic on server when possible
- Add encryption for sensitive data
- Implement basic anti-cheat detection

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit testing for core game mechanics
2. Integration testing for systems interaction
3. Performance testing with simulated players
4. Browser compatibility testing
5. Network condition testing (latency, packet loss)

## Deployment and Scaling
- Use containerization for easy deployment
- Implement horizontal scaling for game servers
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Create CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Implement server region selection for lower latency

## Conclusion
This project plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing "Fight For Humanity." By following these guidelines and utilizing the recommended technologies, LLM coding agents can systematically implement each feature while maintaining code quality and performance standards.
